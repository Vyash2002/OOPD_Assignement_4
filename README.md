The ERP supports all functionalities required in Assignment 4 (Questions 1–5) and includes:

Student data representation with flexible field types

Course mappings between IIT Delhi and IIIT Delhi

Custom multi-threaded sorting (fallback threads, no <thread>)

Fast grade-based search indexing

A fully functional menu-driven interface

The project is modular, with separate files for each question and one integrated program (erp_menu.cpp) that combines all functionalities.
